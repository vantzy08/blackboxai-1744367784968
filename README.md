# Tracking Link Generator

## Project Overview
The Tracking Link Generator is a simple web application that allows users to create tracking links for URLs. When a user generates a tracking link, it redirects to the specified URL while logging the user's IP address on the server. This is useful for tracking where users are accessing particular links from, providing insights into user behavior.

## Installation
To get started with the Tracking Link Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tracking-link-generator
   ```

2. Install the dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter the link you wish to track in the input field.
3. Click the "Generate Tracking Link" button.
4. A tracking link will be displayed. You can click this link to see it in action.

You can also use the `test.js` script to test the tracking link programmatically:
1. Update the `testLink` variable in `test.js` with your desired URL.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   node test.js
   ```
